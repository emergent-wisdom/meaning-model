# Changelog

User-facing changes to the Meaning Model engine, MCP package, and bundled
artifacts. Released entries use package versions and UTC publication dates;
unpublished work stays under Unreleased. This is not a development transcript.

## Unreleased

No changes recorded.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-12

- Make application-selected processes, categories, depth, and optional layers
  explicit in the MCP modeling context, starter prompt, and user guides.
- Distinguish structural starters from experimental Story/Decision models;
  preserve existing template defaults, wire formats, and engine behaviour.
- Add a runnable category-revision example and a bundled guide to developing
  application-specific vocabularies.
- Clarify the paper's general-purpose scope, continuity of understanding, and
  linked world, understanding, and artifact surfaces while retaining its
  storytelling examples and preservation contracts.

Install or build the matching 0.2.1 engine when upgrading the MCP package.
Compared with 0.2.0, this release changes guidance and examples, not the engine's
modeling behavior or stored-data format; no data migration is required. Users
upgrading from 0.1.x should also read the 0.2.0 compatibility and limits below.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-06

### Added

- Refine an existing world after accepted history, or explicitly revise its
  commitments. Both operations check the expected world head and preserve
  immutable before-and-after receipts with a reason and provenance.
- Native temporal Cut recomposition checks: complete duration-weighted
  partitions must reproduce their parent; partial detail must leave a feasible
  remainder. Compatible partial partitions can be completed without rewriting
  earlier children.
- An explicit `--install-engine` command for version-matched prebuilt engines,
  with SHA-256 verification and safe replacement. The release workflow builds
  and checks macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64, and Windows x64 binaries before preparing
  a draft release.
- A runnable progressive-authoring example, including rejection of detail that
  normalizes locally but contradicts its parent.

### Fixed

- Invalid uncertainty values on narrative nodes are rejected.
- MCP command payloads cannot replace reserved operation, schema, or request-ID
  fields.
- Meaning Model queries and estimation-change validation include normalized
  Cuts, context roots, and temporal recomposition contracts, using each
  collection's correct record identifier.

### Changed

- Exclude internal manuscript-maintenance files from future source exports;
  functional engine, model, and example tests remain included.

### Compatibility and limits

- Install or build the matching engine when upgrading the MCP package. Existing
  wire names are retained; models without the new optional temporal contracts
  keep their previous hashes. No automatic data conversion is performed.
- New processes need explicit values at the current world time. Existing process
  shapes and units cannot be changed by a world revision.
- Revision-spanning histories persist in SQLite, and their narrative graphs can
  still be rendered. Portable project/checkpoint and accepted-history training
  exports across those revision boundaries remain unsupported.
- Prebuilt installation supports macOS 14+ arm64/x64, Linux x64 with glibc 2.35+,
  and Windows x64. It needs matching published assets; normal startup never
  downloads or builds an engine. Other platforms can build from source.
- The Book text and paper PDFs are unchanged by these engine improvements.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-05

- Added official MCP Registry metadata and the listing
  `io.github.emergent-wisdom/meaning-model`.
- Clarified `npx` setup and the required path to an explicitly built engine.
- Updated package/version reporting. Rust behavior and bundled model resources
  were unchanged from 0.1.0.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-05

- Initial npm release of `@emergent-wisdom/meaning-model-mcp`, providing a
  stdio MCP interface to the Rust engine with 36 tools and eight resources.
- Bundled Rust sources, modeling resources, presets, and an explicit
  `--build-engine` command. Ordinary installation and startup did not build
  an engine automatically.
